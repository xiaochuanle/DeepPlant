# DeepPlant
We developed DeepPlant, a highly accurate plant methylation detection model, demonstrating a significant performance improvement. DeepPlant was evaluated on species with varying CHH methylation levels, achieving a high correlation of 70%-88% with BS-seq in CHH methylation quantification, outperforming Dorado by over 10.
